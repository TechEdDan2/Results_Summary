## Overview

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Future Development - Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I started to set up using JS to fetch the data from the json file. I was able to use the DOM to access some of the values, but ran into some issues, that I would like to address in a future development. 

### Useful resources

- [HTML_CSS_Help] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Docs 
- [Flexbox Help](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with flexbox. I am sure everyone already uses this website.
